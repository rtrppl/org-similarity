* org-similarity

=org-similarity= is a package to help Emacs [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] users discover similar or related files. Under the hood, it uses Python and [[https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn][scikit-learn]] for text feature extraction, and [[https://github.com/nltk/nltk][nltk]] for text pre-processing. More specifically, this package provides a function to recursively scan a given directory for =org= files, clean their content by stripping the front matter and some undesired characters, tokenize them, replace each token with its respective linguistic stem, generate a TF-IDF sparse matrix, and calculate the cosine similarity between these documents and the buffer you are currently working on.

** Installation

Clone the repository:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/brunoarine/org-similarity
#+end_src

Then load the package by adding it to your =load-path= in your =init.el=:
#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-similarity")
(require 'org-similarity)
#+end_src

Or, with =use-package=:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-similarity
  :load-path  "path/to/org-similarity")
#+end_src

** Configuration

There are a few variables that can be set to customize how =org-similarity= operates and generates the list of similar documents:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Directory to scan for possibly similar documents.
;; org-roam users might want to change it to `org-roam-directory'.
(setq org-similarity-directory org-directory)

;; The language passed to the Snowball stemmer in the `nltk' package.  The
;; following languages are supported: Arabic, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish,
;; French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,
;; Spanish and Swedish.
(setq org-similarity-language "english")

;; How many similar entries to list at the end of the buffer.
(setq org-similarity-number-of-documents 10)

;; Whether to prepend the list entries with similarity scores.
(setq org-similarity-show-scores nil)

;; Whether the resulting list of similar documents will point to ID property or
;; filename. Default it nil.
;; However, I recommend setting it to `t' if you use `org-roam' v2.
(setq org-similarity-use-id-links nil)

;; Scan for files inside `org-similarity-directory' recursively.
(setq org-similarity-recursive-search nil)
#+end_src


** Usage

In a buffer with an open =org-mode= file, type =M-x org-similarity-insert-list RET=.

If this is the first time you run that command, it will ask you to install the necessary Python dependencies. By pressing =y= to continue, it will create a virtual environment under the hood and download the requirements automatically. Once finished, you can close the installation log buffer, and run the command again.

** Changelog

*** 2022-12-26 - v0.2
- Automated installation of Python dependencies (using virtual environments).
- Better =org-roam= v2 compatibility.
- =orgparse= to parse org-mode files.
- Refactored and optimized Python code.

*** 2020-12-05 - v0.1-alpha
- Alpha release of the package.
- Tested with =org-roam= v1.
